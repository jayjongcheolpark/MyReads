### Functionality (requirements)

In this application, the main page(the root URL)displays a list of "shelves" (i.e. categories), each of which contains a number of books. The three shelves are:

* Currently Reading
* Want to Read
* Read

When you select a different shelf, the book moves there.
In search page(`/search`), you can get the list of books as by your input keywords.


### Additional Functionality
#### Using Redux and Redux-Saga
To use redux and redux-saga is easier to manage state and asynchronous things, more efficient to execute, simple to test, and better at handling failure.

#### Throttling
Throttling of 300ms is applied to support live search. If not so, ajax call is too frequent.

#### Autocomplete
This API allows users to use their restricted search keywords. [react-autosuggest](https://github.com/moroshko/react-autosuggest) is added to search a book easily.

#### Optimistic Update
When fetching book list after changing a book shelf, it upates local state before getting a response to show UI changes immediately.


#### Deployment
This App is deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
